# stelem.i8

## SYNOPSIS

Replaces the array element at a given index with the `int64` value on the evaluation stack.

## SYNTAX

```powershell
stelem.i8
```

## DESCRIPTION

The following table lists the instruction's hexadecimal and Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) assembly format, along with a brief reference summary:

| Format | Assembly Format |
| ------ | --------------- |
| 9F     | stelem.i8       |

 The stack transitional behavior, in sequential order, is:

1.  An object reference to an array, `array`, is pushed onto the stack.

2.  A valid index to an element in `array` is pushed onto the stack.

3.  A value is pushed onto the stack.

4.  The value, the index, and the array reference are popped from the stack; the value is put into the array element at the given index.

 The `stelem.i8` instruction replaces the value of the element `index` in the one-dimensional array `array` with the `int64` value pushed onto the stack.

 Arrays are objects and hence represented by a value of type `O`. The index is type `native int`.

 `System.NullReferenceException` is thrown if `array` is a null reference.

 `System.IndexOutOfRangeException` is thrown if `index` is negative, or larger than the bound of `array`.

 `System.ArrayTypeMismatchException` is thrown if `array` does not hold elements of the required type.
