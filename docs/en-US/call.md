# call

## SYNOPSIS

Calls the method indicated by the passed method descriptor.

## SYNTAX

```powershell
call <signature>
```

## DESCRIPTION

The following table lists the instruction's hexadecimal and Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) assembly format, along with a brief reference summary:

| Format     | Assembly Format   |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| 28 < `T` > | call `methodDesc` |

 The stack transitional behavior, in sequential order, is:

1.  Method arguments `arg1` through `argN` are pushed onto the stack.

2.  Method arguments `arg1` through `argN` are popped from the stack; the method call is performed with these arguments and control is transferred to the method referred to by the method descriptor. When complete, a return value is generated by the callee method and sent to the caller.

3.  The return value is pushed onto the stack.

 The `call` instruction calls the method indicated by the method descriptor passed with the instruction. The method descriptor is a metadata token that indicates the method to call and the number, type, and order of the arguments that have been placed on the stack to be passed to that method as well as the calling convention to be used. The `call` instruction can be immediately preceded by a `tail.` prefix instruction to specify that the current method state should be released before transferring control. If the call transfers control to a method of higher trust than the origin method, the stack frame is not released. Instead, the execution continues silently as if the `tail.` had not been supplied. The metadata token carries sufficient information to determine whether the call is to a static method, an instance method, a virtual method, or a global function. In all of these cases the destination address is determined entirely from the method descriptor (contrast this with the `callvirt` instruction for calling virtual methods, where the destination address also depends upon the runtime type of the instance reference pushed before the `callvirt`).

 The arguments are placed on the stack in left-to-right order. That is, the first argument is computed and placed on the stack, then the second argument, then the third, until all necessary arguments are atop the stack in descending order. There are three important special cases:

 1. Calls to an instance (or virtual) method must push that instance reference before any of the user-visible arguments. The instance reference must not be a null reference. The signature carried in the metadata does not contain an entry in the parameter list for the `this` pointer; instead, it uses a bit to indicate whether the method requires passing the `this` pointer.

 2. It is valid to call a virtual method using `call` (rather than `callvirt`); this indicates that the method is to be resolved using the class specified by method rather than as specified dynamically from the object being invoked.

 3. Note that a delegate's `Invoke` method can be called with either the `call` or `callvirt` instruction.

 `System.Security.SecurityException` may be thrown if system security does not grant the caller access to the called method. The security check may occur when the Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) instructions are converted to native code rather than at run time.

> [!NOTE]
>  When calling methods of `System.Object` on value types, consider using the `constrained` prefix with the `callvirt` instruction instead of emitting a `call` instruction. This removes the need to emit different IL depending on whether or not the value type overrides the method, avoiding a potential versioning problem. Consider using the `constrained` prefix when invoking interface methods on value types, since the value type method implementing the interface method can be changed using a `MethodImpl`. These issues are described in more detail in the `constrained.` opcode.
