# ldind.r8

## SYNOPSIS

Loads a value of type `float64` as a type `F` (float) onto the evaluation stack indirectly.

## SYNTAX

```powershell
ldind.r8
```

## DESCRIPTION

The following table lists the instruction's hexadecimal and Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) assembly format, along with a brief reference summary:

| Format | Assembly Format |
| ------ | --------------- |
| 4F     | ldind.r8        |

 The stack transitional behavior, in sequential order, is:

1.  An address is pushed onto the stack.

2.  The address is popped from the stack; the value located at the address is fetched.

3.  The fetched value is pushed onto the stack.

 The `ldind.r8` instruction indirectly loads a `float64` value from the specified address (of type `native int`, `&`, or *) onto the stack as a `float64`.

 All of the `ldind` instructions are shortcuts for a `ldobj` instruction that specifies the corresponding built-in value class.

 Note that integer values of less than 4 bytes are extended to `int32` (not `native int`) when they are loaded onto the evaluation stack. Floating-point values are converted to `F` type when loaded onto the evaluation stack.

 Correctly-formed Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) ensures that the `ldind` instructions are used in a manner consistent with the type of the pointer.

 The address initially pushed onto the stack must be aligned to the natural size of objects on the machine or a `System.NullReferenceException` can occur (see the `unaligned.` prefix instruction for preventative measures). The results of all MSIL instructions that return addresses (for example, `ldloca` and `ldarga`) are safely aligned. For datatypes larger than 1 byte, the byte ordering is dependent on the target CPU. Code that depends on byte ordering might not run on all platforms.

 `System.NullReferenceException` can be thrown if an invalid address is detected.
