# blt.s

## SYNOPSIS

Transfers control to a target instruction (short form) if the first value is less than the second value.

## SYNTAX

```powershell
blt.s <branch_name>
```

## DESCRIPTION

The following table lists the instruction's hexadecimal and Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) assembly format, along with a brief reference summary:

| Format        | Assembly Format |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| 32 < `int8` > | blt.s `target`  |

 The stack transitional behavior, in sequential order, is:

1.  `value1` is pushed onto the stack.

2.  `value2` is pushed onto the stack.

3.  `value2` and `value1` are popped from the stack; if `value1` is less than `value2`, the branch operation is performed.

 The `blt.s` instruction transfers control to the specified target instruction if `value1` is less than `value2`. The effect is identical to performing a `clt` instruction followed by a `brtrue` branch to the specific target instruction. The target instruction is represented as a 1-byte signed offset from the beginning of the instruction following the current instruction.

 If the target instruction has one or more prefix codes, control can only be transferred to the first of these prefixes. Control transfers into and out of `try`, `catch`, `filter`, and `finally` blocks cannot be performed by this instruction.

## PARAMETERS
