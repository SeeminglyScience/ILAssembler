# ldloca.s

## SYNOPSIS

Loads the address of the local variable at a specific index onto the evaluation stack, short form.

## SYNTAX

```powershell
ldloca.s
```

## DESCRIPTION

The following table lists the instruction's hexadecimal and Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) assembly format, along with a brief reference summary:

| Format                 | Assembly Format  |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| 12 < `unsigned int8` > | ldloca.s `index` |

 The stack transitional behavior, in sequential order, is:

1.  The address stored in the local variable at the specified index is pushed onto the stack.

 The `ldloca.s` instruction pushes the address of the local variable number at the passed index onto the stack, where local variables are numbered 0 onwards. The value pushed on the stack is already aligned correctly for use with instructions like `ldind.i` and `stind.i`. The result is a transient pointer (type `*`).

 The `ldloca.s` instruction provides an efficient encoding for use with the local variables 0 through 255.
