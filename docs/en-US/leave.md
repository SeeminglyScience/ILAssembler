# leave

## SYNOPSIS

Exits a protected region of code, unconditionally transferring control to a specific target instruction.

## SYNTAX

```powershell
leave
```

## DESCRIPTION

The following table lists the instruction's hexadecimal and Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) assembly format, along with a brief reference summary:

| Format         | Assembly Format |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| DD < `int32` > | leave `target`  |

 There is no stack transition behavior specified for this instruction.

 The `leave` instruction unconditionally transfers control to the specific target instruction, represented as a 4-byte signed offset from the beginning of the instruction following the current instruction.

 The `leave` instruction is similar to the `br` instruction, but it can be used to exit a `try`, `filter`, or `catch` block whereas the ordinary branch instructions can only be used in such a block to transfer control within it. The `leave` instruction empties the evaluation stack and ensures that the appropriate surrounding `finally` blocks are executed.

 You cannot use a `leave` instruction to exit a `finally` block. To ease code generation for exception handlers it is valid from within a catch block to use a `leave` instruction to transfer control to any instruction within the associated `try` block.

 If an instruction has one or more prefix codes, control can only be transferred to the first of these prefixes.
