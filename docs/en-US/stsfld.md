# stsfld

## SYNOPSIS

Replaces the value of a static field with a value from the evaluation stack.

## SYNTAX

```powershell
stsfld
```

## DESCRIPTION

The following table lists the instruction's hexadecimal and Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) assembly format, along with a brief reference summary:

| Format     | Assembly Format |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| 80 < `T` > | stsfld `field`  |

 The stack transitional behavior, in sequential order, is:

1.  A value is pushed onto the stack.

2.  A value is popped from the stack and stored in `field`.

 The `stsfld` instruction replaces the value of a static field with a value from the stack. `field` is a metadata token that must refer to a static field member.

 The `stsfld` instruction may be prefixed by `volatile.`.

 `System.MissingFieldException` is thrown if field is not found in the metadata. This is typically checked when Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) instructions are converted to native code, not at run time.
